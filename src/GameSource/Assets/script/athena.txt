Oh, hello. It's been a while since we've last had a visitor.
I could use some help with preparing for tonight's meal.
Seeing as you can't go anywhere due to the approaching storm, why not help me hunt for dinner.

If you don't know, you can press shift to cast Icicle.
Come back to me when you have 10 spheal meats.
You can find them through the huntingground portal to the right.
Oh! Take these 20 red and blue potions to aid you.
Double clicking will allow you to use the item.

Oh wow! These will taste delicious!
Here, I found these shoes. Thanks for the hard work!
It looks like the storm has subsided. 
I know you're interested in the time situation.
Chief Stan appears to have discovered something.
