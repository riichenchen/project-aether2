Note: all animations are organized by set and then animation track

example:

my character set
     my walking animation
	 my standing animation
	 my jumping animation
/my character set <- this indicates that we're done loading in this specific sprite set

in each animation, the structure of the directory is as follows

animations/animation folder/animation track/info.txt

within that text file, we give them the number of sprites (which refer to each photo using an integer
in increasing order), the offset, as well as the actual track

example:

5 <-5 sprite images
x,y <-the offset
imageId1,timedelay_in_millis imageId2,timedelay_in_millis etc
